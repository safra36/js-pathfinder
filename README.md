# js-pathfinder

## what this project is?
this project is what i was about to do for my university electrical circuit lesson, well you might say what's the relation, the relation is not for the lesseon it self but for robotic projects in the futrue, the practice is written in js but it's simply portable to any other languages anyone would need

## which is the current state of the project?
it's incomplete since of me laking time to attend to it, i'll try to do so as soon as i find time in the future

## Are there any bugs?
tbh tons :D, the path finding algorithm does not work well and it cannot find what's hindering it, it's due to a bug in raycasting algorithim on the edges, there is already another one  out there but it's not yet been implimented

## todo
- replace the raycasting algorithm with the new one
- performance boost
- avoid runtime calculations for paths (creating navigation files if needed).
- other stuff that i don't have in mind yet :D


## contribution
Feel free to fork my project and improve it (i know it looks like crap at it's current state but i'll be glad )
